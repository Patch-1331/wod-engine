# Security Policy

Regimen Works is a personal project with a live deployment: the API at
<https://wod-engine-api.onrender.com> and the web app at
<https://wod-engine-web.onrender.com>, both auto-deployed from `main`. There is
no released version line — `main` is what is running, so security fixes reach
production as soon as they merge.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a security problem.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on this repository
(**Security** → **Report a vulnerability**), which opens a private advisory
visible only to the maintainer.

Expect an acknowledgement within a week. As a solo hobby project this comes
with no formal response-time or disclosure commitment.

## What we do

- **Dependabot alerts and security updates** are enabled; vulnerable
  dependencies open automated pull requests.
- **GitHub Actions** run with a read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` and third-party
  actions are pinned to full commit SHAs.
- **Secrets** are never committed. `.env` files are gitignored;
  `apps/api/.env.example` documents the required variables with dummy values.
- **gitleaks** scans the full git history on every push and pull request, and
  runs as a pre-commit hook locally (`npm run hooks:install`).
- **CodeQL** static analysis and **dependency review** run on pull requests.
- **Every route requires a verified Clerk session token** — the guard is bound
  globally, so a new controller is authenticated by default rather than by
  remembering to add a decorator. The health check is the sole exception.
- **Every query is scoped to the requesting user**, and the database enforces
  it independently: sessions and logs carry a composite foreign key onto
  `(assignment id, user id)`, so a row whose owner disagrees with its
  assignment's cannot be stored at all.
- **Rate limiting** is applied per client IP across all routes.
- **Sign-up is invite-only.** The repository is public and the database is
  small; open registration would let any passer-by provision rows. This is a
  Clerk dashboard setting, so it leaves no trace in this repository — it is
  recorded here because nothing in the code will reveal it.

## Running the checks yourself

```sh
npm run hooks:install   # one time: enable the pre-commit secret scan
npm run security:scan   # gitleaks over the full history
npm run security:audit  # npm audit, production dependencies only
```

gitleaks is expected on `PATH` (`brew install gitleaks`). The pre-commit hook
skips with a warning if it is missing rather than failing the commit.
