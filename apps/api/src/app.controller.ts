  // Render's health check can't send an auth header.
  //
  // It is exempt from rate limiting too, and deliberately so: Render's probes
  // arrive from its own network rather than through the Cloudflare edge, so
  // they share one tracker key, and a throttled probe reads as an unhealthy
  // service and restarts it. Being rate limited into a restart loop is a worse
  // outcome than an unthrottled route that returns a constant string.
  //
  // Every tier has to be named explicitly. A bare @SkipThrottle() sets
  // `{ default: true }`, which matches nothing when the tiers are named — it
  // reads as an exemption while silently being none.
