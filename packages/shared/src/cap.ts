/**
 * The time cap, as the clock reads it.
 *
 * Every WOD carries a cap (`Wod.timeCapMinutes`, copied onto the session as
 * `capSeconds`) and reaching it ends the workout: an AMRAP scores whatever was
 * done inside the cap, and a For Time that runs out of road is capped rather
 * than credited with however long the athlete kept going. So the clock stops
 * at the cap instead of running past it.
 *
 * This module is the one place that decides where "stopped" is. The workout
 * screen freezes its readout with it and the API records a finish with it, so
 * the number the athlete last saw is the number that gets logged.
 *
 * An athlete can opt out (`Settings.autoStopAtCapEnabled`), which every caller
 * reads off the session's own `autoStopAtCap` rather than from here: the cap
 * arithmetic is the same either way, and only whether it *binds* changes.
