/**
 * How a movement's reps are divided across rounds.
 *
 * Two things can do the dividing, and they are not equals:
 *
 *  - A **rep scheme** (`WodMovement.repScheme`) — the workout's own structure,
 *    e.g. [21, 15, 9]. It comes from the WOD and is not the athlete's to
 *    change.
 *  - A **manual split** (`WorkoutSession.roundSplitCount`) — an athlete
 *    breaking a long flat movement into chunks mid-session, e.g. 45 push-ups
 *    as 5 x 9.
 *
 * Where both are present the scheme wins: it is how the workout is meant to be
 * performed, so it outranks a stale manual choice. That rule lives here, in the
 * one implementation both the web client and the API's advancement math call,
 * because the alternative — the screen counting one workout while the
 * progression lines are credited another — is exactly the bug this module
 * exists to make unrepresentable.
